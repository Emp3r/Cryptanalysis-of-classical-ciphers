  <h2>Caesar cipher</h2>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>One of the simplest substitution ciphers. Each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter shifted by number of positions down the alphabet. Key is single character from english alphabet.</p>

  <h3>History</h3>
  <p>The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it (with a shift of three) to protect military messages back in the 1st century BC. It was probably effective, since the first frequency analysis records date to the 9th century AD in the Arab world. There is evidence that Julius Caesar used more complicated systems as well.
    <br>A Caesar cipher with a shift of one is also used on the back of the Hebrew mezuzah (verses from the Torah written on animal skin) to encrypt the names of God. </p>
